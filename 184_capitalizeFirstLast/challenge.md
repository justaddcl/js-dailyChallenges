For this challenge, you will have to write a function called `capitalizeFirstLast` or `capitalize_first_last`.
This function will capitalize the first and last letter of each word, and lowercase what is in between.

`capitalizeFirstLast "and still i rise" -- "AnD StilL I RisE"`

## Rules:

The function will take a single parameter, which will be a string.
The string can contain words separated by a single space.
Words are made of letters from the ASCII range only.
The function should return a string.
Only the first and last letters are uppercased.
All the other letters should be lowercased.

## Examples:

- `capitalizeFirstLast "and still i rise"` -- "AnD StilL I RisE"
- `capitalizeFirstLast "when words fail music speaks"` -- "WheN WordS FaiL MusiC SpeakS"
- `capitalizeFirstLast "WHAT WE THINK WE BECOME"` -- "WhaT WE ThinK WE BecomE"
- `capitalizeFirstLast "dIe wITh mEMORIEs nOt dREAMs"` -- "DiE WitH MemorieS NoT DreamS"
- `capitalizeFirstLast "hello"` -- "HellO"

Good luck!
