Skipping the Scrabble challenge since it was only implemented in C#

Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word. Leave punctuation marks untouched.

## Examples

```
pigIt('Pig latin is cool'); // igPay atinlay siay oolcay
pigIt('Hello world !');     // elloHay orldway !
```
